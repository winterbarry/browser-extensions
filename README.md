# Browser Extensions Manager

A lightweight web-based interface for managing browser extensions.
This project allows users to view, filter, activate/deactivate, remove, and theme-toggle extension items through a dynamic and responsive interface.

---

## 📖 Overview

The Browser Extensions Manager provides a dashboard-like experience for handling a list of browser extensions.
It dynamically renders extensions from a dataset (`data.json`), allowing the user to:

* View all available extensions with their logos and descriptions
* Filter extensions by status (*All*, *Active*, *Inactive*)
* Toggle extensions on/off
* Remove unwanted extensions
* Switch between light and dark themes

All updates happen on the client side without requiring a page reload.

* Filtering: Buttons allow filtering between *All*, *Active*, or *Inactive* extensions.
* Toggling: Each extension includes a switch to enable/disable it.
* Removal: Extensions can be removed instantly from the list.
* Theme Switching: Toggle between light and dark modes using the sun/moon icon.
* Responsive Design: Grid layout adapts seamlessly to desktop and mobile screens.

## Component Breakdown

### `template.html`

Defines the structure of the page including:

* The extension bar with logo and theme toggle.
* A filter section for switching between extension categories.
* A grid container (`.extensions-list`) where extension cards are dynamically inserted.

---

### `index.js`

* Initializes rendering when the DOM is loaded.
* Handles:

  * Theme switching (`toggleTheme`)
  * Filter button clicks (`filterExtensions`)
  * Extension removal (`deleteExtension`)
  * Toggle switch updates (`toggleExtension`)

---

### `filter.js`

* Manages the extension dataset and the current filter state.
* Exposes functions:

  * `filterExtensions(filter)` – Filters dataset by status.
  * `toggleExtension(name)` – Toggles the `isActive` property.
  * `getDataset()` / `setDataset()` – Manage internal data state.

---

### `render.js`

* Handles initial rendering and filtered rendering.
* Updates DOM elements dynamically.
* Controls theme switching and image updates based on the current mode.

---

### `style.css`

Defines the project’s styling, including:

* Theme-based color palettes.
* Layouts for containers and cards.
* Buttons and toggle switch interactions.
* Responsive adjustments for screens below 768px.

---

## Theme System

The theme system supports:

* Dark Mode: Deep blue gradient background, light text.
* Light Mode: Soft, airy gradient background, dark text.

Theme preference is detected automatically via the user's system (`prefers-color-scheme`), but can be toggled manually via the theme button.
